# RISK-AND-RETURNS-CALCULATION-BASED-ON-SHARPE-RATIO



## DESCRIPTION

When analyzing investment opportunities, it's important to consider not only the expected returns but also the level of risk involved. The Sharpe ratio is a popular risk/return measure that compares the expected returns of two investment options and calculates the additional return per unit of risk that an investor could obtain by choosing one over the other. In our example, we will use the stocks of Facebook and Amazon and compare their returns to the S&P 500 index as a benchmark. The Sharpe ratio can be used to evaluate the performance of a portfolio manager by comparing the returns earned relative to a low-cost index fund. By considering both returns and risk, the Sharpe ratio provides a useful tool for comparing different investment opportunities and making informed investment decisions.

 The dataset contains information on the amount of debt owed by developing countries in various categories (in USD). The data will look for answers to questions like:
 
1. What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
2. Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
3. What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
